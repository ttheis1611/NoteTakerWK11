## Description
A handy web site of 2 pages hosted on Heroku at https://notetakerwk11.herokuapp.com/. This page will have a splash page with a start	button that redirects to the NOTE taking page that then allows the user to add a title and text for a NOTE, then saves that data to display by clicking on that note. If the note is no longer needed, then there is the ability to delete the note.
